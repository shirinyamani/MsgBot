# Telegram Bot for Random messaging!
Please refer to this repo of me [Telegram Template Bot](https://github.com/shirinyamani/PyBot) for finding the Telegram Template Bot I coded as a template for any bot. 
# How to run?

1. Set the directory same as where you clone this project then Export Python path via: `PYTHONPATH=${PWD}`
2. Get your `BOT_TOKEN ` from telegram [@BotFather](@BotFather) then export it in your terminal project directory via `os.environ['BOT_TOKEN']`
3. Run `python src/run.py` in your Terminal.
